#    Welcome to the Parliament's brand new HR Management System

## It's a little limited but it's got potential

And here we are again, like the last time, I tried to show a little bit of everything. It is currently 5:27am so the final touches might be... Questionable. Just don't look at the css, trust me it's fine! 

Jokes aside, as much as I'd LOVE to finish all the features that were in my head, my limited time, disastrous refactors and two full days in a row of coding can only do so much...

STILL! I am quite proud of this little guy right here, maybe not quite a looker as my past attempt (I mean, I did create this one mostly from scratch whereas the other time I had everything already designed... Goes to show the importance of designers and UX engineers!) but it still has some neat features including a solid foundation for a RESTful API with a robust linking system that "self-documents" itself.

Once again, I do hope it runs on your machine!
